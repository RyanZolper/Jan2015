# Create an Assignments Repo

For this class, you will have your own assignments repo where you will turn in most of your homework, and, where I will assign work to you via GitHub issues.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub don't worry, I'll provide some tutorials and we'll go over it in class. But this is a good opportunity to get a head start with your onboarding.

## First, create a repository called _Assignments_

Read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) article on how to create a repository. It will be a public repository. Only create the repository. No need to commit anything to it yet.

## Second, add me as a collaborator to this new repository

Read [the article on adding a collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/). You are adding me so I can push assignments to you. My GitHub username is _brianburridge_.

## That's it!

Once you've done this let me know by emailing me a link to the repository on github.com. I'll push a test assignment to you and then your onboarding work.
