# Welcome to The Iron Yard - Tampa / St. Petersburg

If you are reading this you are now part of the Jan 2015 Rails Engineering class for The Iron Yard's Tampa Bay campus.

I hope you are as excited as I am. We will be going through a large amount of content over the next 12 weeks. You'll need to stay sharp and well rested, and put in a lot of work. If you do, you will come out the other side of this journey with not only new skills, but more importantly, a confidence in yourself to be able to learn new and challenging concepts and hopefully a new way of thinking and problem solving.

In order for you to be as prepared as possible for day one, I will be passing along some pre-assignments and information.

I will create an 'issue' in your GitHub Assignments repository for each of you to complete. It will contain a list of assignments and tasks. Please check them off as you complete them. If you have any questions as you go, leave them as comments on the issue.

Do not close your issue out. I will close it out on day one.

This prework is not mean to be the only time we cover the topics, it is only the first time. It helps lay a foundation so we can get started very quickly. It will help you become familiar with the terminology and tools necessary for the class.

Thanks and best wishes. You can do this.
